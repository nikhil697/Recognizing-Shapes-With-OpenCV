# Recognizing-Shapes-With-OpenCV
<h3>In this Project we will work with a real-world digital image, process it using computer vision techniques and use Hough tranforms to detect shapes.</h2><br>

## Task 1: Load an image from file
## Task 2: Compute image gradients
## Task 3: Detect edges in an image
## Task 4: Recognize lines in an image
## Task 5: Recognize circles in an image
